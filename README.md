# Predicting-Plus-Minus-In-the-NBA
In this repo, you'll find a Jupyter Notebook that walks through some simple machine learning models used to predict the 'plus/minus' statistic  for NBA players. 
The data comes from the 2015-2016 Regular NBA Season. This data can also be found in this repo as a csv file.
